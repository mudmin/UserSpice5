# Security Policy
We actively maintin the latest version of our software and back port patches to the older 4.x, 3.x and 2.x versions whenever patching the old version is more feasable than asking the user to upgrade to the latest version.  In other words, although version 4.x is no longer actively supported, if it is possible to offer an update to allow the user to continue using that software without forcing them to upgrade to 5.x, we will do so.  It is, however strongly recommended that you use the latest version.
