TO CREATE A NEW LANGUAGE, COPY THE en-us.php to your own localization code name.
We are going to keep these files in the iso xx-xx format because that will also
allow us to autoformat numbers on the sites.

PLEASE put your name somewhere at the top of the language file so we can get in touch with
you to update it and thank you for your hard work!

PLEASE NOTE: DO NOT ADD RANDOM KEYS in the middle of the translations.  In order to make it easier to tell what language keys are missing, from this point forward, we are going to add all new language keys at the BOTTOM of this file. The number of lines in your language file will tell you which keys still need to be translated.  If you have questions please ask on the forums or on Discord.
