// This file often teams up with during_user_creation.php although you can use that file without this one.
// However, if you add additional form fields here, you should process them there.
// We will do an example. Let's say you want to make use of the unused account_id column in the users table.

// Uncomment out the code below and it will automagically be inserted into your join form.

<!-- <label for="confirm">Pick an account ID number</label>
<input type="number" class="form-control" min="0" step="1" name="account_id" value="" required> -->

<?php
//Now, go into the during_user_creation script to see how to process it.
